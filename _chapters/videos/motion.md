## What is visual intelligence?

Visual intelligence describes the ability to see and understand the deeper context of what is happening. Visual intelligence is critical for planning, informing future action, and understanding high-level semantics such as goals and intents. For example, a still image of a tiger towering over a man may suggest an attack is in progress. However, a video showing the tiger gently standing over the man (never laying its paws on his body), playfully retreating, and repeating this behavior, would suggest the tiger is simply playingâ€”humans have ability to perceive such high-level semantics from visual observation. Why is visual intelligence important? Human memories are deeply shaped by the context of events and actions; our lived experiences extend beyond simple object recognition. 

## How could machines perceive events? 

How do we build machines that can see and understand events as humans do? Many human experiences are captured on videos. Understanding how the human brain perceives an example video may offer some insight.
